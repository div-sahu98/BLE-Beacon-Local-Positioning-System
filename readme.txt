this is  a  basic  DJango code  with logic to calculate  position 
of  ble  beacon in 10mX10m area.
this project will additionally req anroid APK for ble  beacon detection 
and a rasberry pi for  configuration it  a  beacon for signal emission.
you can get  this  info at

https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-bluetooth-beacon-using-eddystone-ble-beacon
for the  configuration 


and  configure the pi to beacon 
by describing
